helpTopics = {
    ["Intro"] = "Welcome to Imperium Gaming's Cold War RP!\n\nThis server runs our custom ImperiumRP gamemode—designed from the ground up for an immersive, player-driven MRP experience. No Nutscript clones or DarkRP reskins here! This is the unique MRP server you've been searching for.\n\nThis Help Menu will guide you through the server's features, gameplay, and custom content. Need to reopen this menu? Type /help in chat anytime! Select a topic on the left to learn more.\n\nGetting Started:\n\nYou've created a character and chosen your side—great now is time to join your first Division. Divisions are fully player-controlled and managed in-game. Any player can create one and unlock classes, ranks, and upgrades! For now, we recommend joining an existing Division to access their custom classes, rank up, and learn the ropes. Ask to Join someones Division!",
    ["Unlocking Weapons"] = "You can unlock weapons at the Weapon Crate located near spawn. Your Division, including recruits, will have base weapons already unlocked for you to use.\n\nThere are Primary, Secondary, and Miscellaneous slots where you can customize your loadout. You earn QM Points by killing players, collecting supplies, looting bodys, and actively playing on the server. These QM Points can then be used at the Weapon Crate to unlock new weapons!\n\nIn addition to Division-provided base weapons, some weapons are unlocked through specific classes, such as the Sniper class. There are also VIP only weapons that are not overpowered and are just for fun.",
    ["Divisions"] = "All Divisions on this server are player-managed, created, and controlled.\n\nWho is allowed into a Division is entirely up to the Division owner. The owner can also decide which classes can be unlocked and spends divisional supplies to unlock these classes, making their Division unique. The owner's rank is tied to the rank of the Division, which is determined by weekly activity. This means that inactive Divisions will have lower ranks, while active Divisions will achieve higher ranks.\n\nDivision ranks also determine how many classes a Division can have.\n\nAnyone on the server can create a Division for 60,000 QM Points and invite players to grow it to its maximum rank. This is a fully player-driven experience. Click F3 to open the Division Menu.",
    ["Specializations"] = "Specializations (or classes) are unlockable by Divisions through the use of divisional supply.\nSpecializations require a certain level of weekly activity and may have prerequisite Specializations that need to be unlocked first, along with the necessary supply.\n\nOnce a Division owner or Division admin unlocks a Specialization, they can whitelist members of their Division for that class, giving them full control over who has access to these roles. Classes can include Medics, Engineers, Tankers, Pilots, and more!\n\nWe encourage Division owners to be creative and build unique Divisions. Specializations can always be replaced if needed.",
    ["Outposts"] = "Outposts are extremely important for reinforcing the frontline. Without an outpost, it will be difficult to get players to the front lines, and you may lose the objective!\n\nOutposts can be created by trusted+ members of a Division as well as Engineers. These outposts take about 90 seconds to construct, and each Division is limited to one outpost at a time.\n\nOnce an outpost is constructed, players can use the Outpost Radio at spawn to spawn at these locations. However, if an enemy player is near an outpost, it will be considered under attack, and spawning will be disabled until the threat is resolved.\n\nWe encourage players to prioritize constructing and protecting forward outposts to maintain control of the battlefield!",
    ["Supply"] = "Supply is essential for deploying vehicles, aircraft, spawning entities, and constructing outposts.\n\nWithout supply, your side will struggle to maintain combat effectiveness and fight effectively.\n\nThere are two types of supply: Global and Local Division supply.\n\nWhen you collect supply, it contributes to both your Division's supply and the global supply. For example, if you collect a crate worth 100 supply, it will add 100 supply to both your Division and the global pool.\n\n When using supply, you will use your Division supply. If your Division is out of supply, it will use the Global Supply Instead.\n\nYou can use the command /supply to view the supply log. There is zero tolerance for supply wastage, and actions are logged for accountability.\n\nOutside of the Daily Operation, the cost of everything is reduced by 75%.",
    ["Supply Refinery"] = "Each point outputs Crude Oil every 5 minutes. This Crude Oil can only be collected by the owner of the point. Crude Oil can then be refined into Supply.\n\nTrusted+ players can spawn a Supply Refinery that takes 10 minutes to refine 100 Crude Oil into Supply. There can only be one refinery per division on the map at any given time. Refineries cannot be placed near spawn areas, as this violates server rules.\n\nThe refinery creates 25 residue Supply for every 100 Crude Oil it refines. Enemies can destroy the refinery and collect the residue Supply. Residue Supply is deducted from the division's supply when the refinery is removed or destroyed. Be aware of this when spawning a new refinery, as it will drop residue Supply. Residue Supply only contributes to the division's supply, not the global supply, when collected.",
    ["Frontline System"] = "There are 5 objectives: A, B, C, D, and E.\n\nObjectives spawn supply barrels that can be collected and also indicate the current battlefield supremacy.\n\nObjectives must be captured in order. The highlighted objectives on the bottom-right of your screen show the current frontline points, which are the ones that should be attacked or defended.\n\nThe capture rate is static and only requires a majority presence to begin capturing. To locate an objective, use the compass and the distance indicator at the bottom-right of your screen. By monitoring the distance as it decreases while following a direction, you can pinpoint the location of the objective.\n\nAll maps have 5 objectives.",
    ["Daily Operation"] = "Every day at 5 EST, the Daily Operation takes place.\n\nThe current frontline and ongoing battle can be seen at the bottom-right of your screen. The Daily Operation (or Daily Offensive, as some call it) is the opportunity for the attackers to push the defenders back. If one side wins all maps, they win the war, and the system will be reset.\n\nDuring the operation, defenders are given time to prepare a defense for all 5 objectives on the map. Once the preparation time is over, the attackers must attempt to capture all 5 objectives.\n\nThe attackers have a time limit to complete their mission but gain additional time with each objective they capture. If the frontline objective is contested, the battle will not end, even if the timer reaches 0.\n\nThe Daily Operation is the most intense and exciting event this server has to offer. We encourage all players to join at 5 EST to help their side achieve victory!",

    ["Hand Swep"] = "The Hand Swep is a custom SWEP that allows you to move props and objects by holding left click and dragging.\n\nThis can be used to move barrles, corpses, props, and anything else that is not nailed down!\n\nIts a very fun swep and adds a lot of gmod goofines to the server... Prop Killing is allowed if you can pull it off, and can lead to some extreamly fun moments.\n\nRight Click allows you to Salute, and Left Click allows you to move objects.",
    ["Levels and XP"] = "ImperiumRP has three main stats:\n\nEndurance (Health Regen)\nAthletics (Faster Run and Higher Jump)\nBallistics (Less Recoil and Spread)\n\nAll these states give a small bonus in its respective field, making high level players more effective in combat. Saying that, a level 1 player can still kill a level 70 player, but the level 70 player will have a slight advantage. Killing a higher level player means you gain more XP!\n\nYou can level up and gain XP by playing on the server, killing players, looting bodys, and collecting Supply. You can view your level and stats by pressing F1. You start with 10 points to spend.\n\nEvery Level gets you 2 points to spend on your Character, however levels will get exponentially harder to obtain, being around level 70+ is considered a max leveled player.\n\nSome players played during WW2, and this allows them to carry over there skils they had before, as they are veterans.",
    ["VIP"] = "This server is run on donations. All of the money goes into funding custom content (like the ImperiumRP gamemode!) and paying for the Server Box, our Linux Machine in the Background that runs alot of our custom features, and our Webiste!\n\nDonate by typing /donate\n\nVIP gets you VIP only weapons, Double XP and QM points, and a role in our discord! The Donation helps us keep this server alive, and we are beyond appreciative for everyone who has helped us financially in making our dream server!\n\nIf you buy a Supply Drop package do /claim to get it in game!",
    ["Radiation and Atomics"] = "Ever since the splitting of the atom, the world has changed forever. Atomic warfare is now a reality, with radioactive weapons and materials commonplace.\n\nAround the map, you will find Nuclear Waste. Avoid this. Exposure to too much radiation will lead to radiation sickness and death. A little exposure is okay, but too much will guarantee your doom.\n\nIf there is an Atomic Specialist class, there is even more to be warned about. They can collect this waste and use it in nuclear reactors to create weapons-grade plutonium, which can lead to the creation of nuclear weapons.\n\nAvoid contact with both the reactors and the materials Atomic Specialists leave behind. Radiation is a silent but quick killer. Only Medics and Atomic Specialists can see radiation levels of players.\n\nYou may recover from radiation poisoning depending on how much you have been exposed, being healed by a Medic Box lowers your raditation levels quicker and can help stabilize your condition.",
    ["Reviving and Looting"] = "In this gamemode, when you die your corpse will remain on the battlefield. This can be dragged around and the player (if they have not respawned) can see whats going on.\n\nYou can be revived by a Medic, and can see how close the nearest medic is. Medics will get a green glow around all players that can be revived, so can see your corpse through walls.\n\nTo prevent players being revived you can loot there corpses, this will take 5 seconds and you will gain supply, XP and QM points!",
    ["Oil Drilling"] = "Logistics have the ability to spawn Oil Drills, which cost 250 supply to deploy. These drills can prospect for oil and take 30-60 seconds to locate any oil deposits.\n\nEvery map change or restart resets the oil deposits on the map, allowing new prospecting opportunities.\n\nWhen an oil deposit is found, you've hit black gold! Until the deposit (typically around 20,000 oil) is fully extracted, your drill will continue collecting crude oil from the earth.\n\nDrills and oil deposits cannot be placed in spawn.\n\nThe enemy will want to destroy your oil field. Once you discover an oil deposit, if they know its location they might attempt to destroy it while establishing their own.\n\nOil deposits are rare, so don’t be discouraged if it takes time to find one. However, once you do, you'll be rolling in QM Points, XP, and, of course, supply for refining!"
