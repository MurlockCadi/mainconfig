    ["Intro"] = "Welcome to Imperium Gaming's WW2 Axis VS Allies RP!\n\nThis server is running a custom MRP gamemode known as 'ImperiumRP' (We are not another DarkRP re-name or a NS Clone!)\n\nThis Help Menu will guide you through the servers features, gameplay, and custom content. Need to reopen this menu? Type /help in chat anytime!\n\nSelect a topic on the left to learn more.\n\nGetting Started:\n\nYou have spawned in as a recruit, to progress you need to Join Someones Division! In this server all Divisions are player created and run, you can also make your own division when you have 60,000QM points (our currency!) ask around in /ooc or by speaking to people if you can join a division, there you will be trained and given classes that they have unlocked! Not sure who to join? You can stay as recruit as long as you want, you can get a weapon by going up to the weapons crate.\n\nAnd again Welcome to the Server!\n\n-Murlock",     
    ["Unlocking Weapons"] = "You can unlock weapons at the Weapon Crate located near spawn. Your Division, including recruits, will have base weapons already unlocked for you to use.\n\nThere are Primary, Secondary, and Miscellaneous slots where you can customize your loadout. You earn QM Points by killing players, collecting supplies, looting bodys, and actively playing on the server. These QM Points can then be used at the Weapon Crate to unlock new weapons!\n\nIn addition to Division-provided base weapons, some weapons are unlocked through specific classes, such as the Sniper class. There are also VIP only weapons that are not overpowered and are just for fun.",
    ["Divisions"] = "All Divisions on this server are player-managed, created, and controlled.\n\nWho is allowed into a Division is entirely up to the Division owner. The owner can also decide which classes can be unlocked and spends divisional supplies to unlock these classes, making their Division unique. The owner's rank is tied to the rank of the Division, which is determined by weekly activity. This means that inactive Divisions will have lower ranks, while active Divisions will achieve higher ranks.\n\nDivision ranks also determine how many classes a Division can have.\n\nAnyone on the server can create a Division for 60,000 QM Points and invite players to grow it to its maximum rank. This is a fully player-driven experience. Click F3 to open the Division Menu.",
    ["Specializations"] = "Specializations (or classes) are unlockable by Divisions through the use of divisional supply.\nSpecializations require a certain level of weekly activity and may have prerequisite Specializations that need to be unlocked first, along with the necessary supply.\n\nOnce a Division owner or Division admin unlocks a Specialization, they can whitelist members of their Division for that class, giving them full control over who has access to these roles. Classes can include Medics, Engineers, Tankers, Pilots, and more!\n\nWe encourage Division owners to be creative and build unique Divisions. Specializations can always be replaced if needed.",
    ["Outposts"] = "Outposts are extremely important for reinforcing the frontline. Without an outpost, it will be difficult to get players to the front lines, and you may lose the objective!\n\nOutposts can be created by trusted+ members of a Division as well as Engineers. These outposts take about 90 seconds to construct, and each Division is limited to one outpost at a time.\n\nOnce an outpost is constructed, players can use the Outpost Radio at spawn to spawn at these locations. However, if an enemy player is near an outpost, it will be considered under attack, and spawning will be disabled until the threat is resolved.\n\nWe encourage players to prioritize constructing and protecting forward outposts to maintain control of the battlefield!",
    ["Supply and Manpower"] = "Supply is essential for deploying tanks, spawning entities, and constructing outposts.\n\nWithout supply, your side will struggle to maintain combat effectiveness and fight effectively.\n\nOutside of the Daily Operation, the cost of everything is reduced by 75%\n\nYou generate supply with the Supply Factory: this turns Scrap into Supply. Bring scrap up to your Divisions Supply Factory and click e to collect it (and you will also get a reward!)\n\nThe Factory then produces supply and manpower for your side. Manpower is used in Trench Attacks, but also used while defending. You cant advance a trenchline without spending manpower. Admins+ in a division can transfer supply to other divisions in the Management Menu.", 
    ["Scrap Factory"] = "Each trench produces scrap every 5 minutes. This Scrap can be used in a factory to be turned into Supply.\n\nTrusted+ players can spawn a Scrap Factory that takes 5 minutes to refine 100 Scrap into Supply and 10 Manpower. There can only be one refinery per division on the map at any given time. Factorys cannot be placed near spawn areas, as this violates server rules.\n\nThe Factory creates 50 residue Supply for every 100 Scrap it refines. Enemies can destroy the Factory and collect the residue Supply. Residue Supply is deducted from the division's supply when the Factory is removed or destroyed. Be aware of this when spawning a new Factory, as it will drop residue Supply. To stop collecting the Residue Supply early, there is a 90min wait between spawning in a new one. But if your Factory was destroyed, you can spawn one in right away.",
    ["Frontline System"] = "There are 5 Points: A, B, C, D, and E.\n\nPoints must be captured in order. The highlighted objectives on the bottom-right of your screen show the current frontline Points, which are the ones that will be attacked and defended.\n\nThe capture rate is static and only requires a majority presence to begin capturing. To locate an objective, use the compass and the distance indicator at the bottom-right of your screen. By monitoring the distance as it decreases while following a direction, you can pinpoint the location of the objective.\n\nAll maps have 5 objectives / Trenches.\n\nThe Commander cna use the /trench command where they can call Raids and Assaults. In Assaults Manpower is at risk for both the attacker and defender, the Commander dictates how much manpower is used in an Assault, if the Timer Runs out, or the Attackers run out of manpower, the Defenders will win.",
    ["Daily Operation"] = "Every day at 5 EST, the Daily Operation takes place.\n\nThe current frontline and ongoing battle can be seen at the bottom-right of your screen. The Daily Operation (or Daily Offensive, as some call it) is the opportunity for the attackers to push the defenders back. If one side wins all maps, they win the war, and the system will be reset.\n\nDuring the operation, defenders are given time to prepare a defense for all 5 objectives on the map. Once the preparation time is over, the attackers must attempt to capture all 5 objectives.\n\nThe attackers have a time limit to complete their mission but gain additional time with each objective they capture. If the frontline objective is contested, the battle will not end, even if the timer reaches 0.\n\nThe Daily Operation is the most intense and exciting event this server has to offer. We encourage all players to join at 5 EST to help their side achieve victory!",

Prop Killing is allowed if you can pull it off, and can lead to some extreamly fun moments.\n\nRight Click allows you to Salute, and Left Click allows you to move objects.",
    ["Levels and XP"] = "ImperiumRP has three main stats:\n\nEndurance (Health Regen)\nAthletics (Faster Run and Higher Jump)\nBallistics (Less Recoil and Spread)\n\nAll these states give a small bonus in its respective field, making high level players more effective in combat. Saying that, a level 1 player can still kill a level 70 player, but the level 70 player will have a slight advantage. Killing a higher level player means you gain more XP!\n\nYou can level up and gain XP by playing on the server, killing players, looting bodys, and collecting Supply. You can view your level and stats by pressing F1. You start with 10 points to spend.\n\nEvery Level gets you 2 points to spend on your Character, however levels will get exponentially harder to obtain, being around level 70+ is considered a max leveled player.\n\nSome players played during WW2, and this allows them to carry over there skils they had before, as they are veterans.",
    ["VIP"] = "This server is run on donations. All of the money goes into funding custom content (like the ImperiumRP gamemode!) and paying for the Server Box, our Linux Machine in the Background that runs alot of our custom features, and our Webiste!\n\nDonate by typing /donate\n\nVIP gets you VIP only weapons, Double XP and QM points, and a role in our discord! The Donation helps us keep this server alive, and we are beyond appreciative for everyone who has helped us financially in making our dream server!\n\nIf you buy a Supply Drop package do /claim to get it in game!",
    ["Reviving and Looting"] = "In this gamemode, when you die your corpse will remain on the battlefield. This can be dragged around and the player (if they have not respawned) can see whats going on.\n\nYou can be revived by a Medic, and can see how close the nearest medic is. Medics will get a green glow around all players that can be revived, so can see your corpse through walls.\n\nTo prevent players being revived you can loot there corpses, this will take 5 seconds and you will gain supply, XP and QM points!\n\nDuring a Risky Action where Manpower is at stake, Reviving players will grant a lost manpower back",
