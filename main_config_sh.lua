helpTopics = {
    ["Intro"] = "Welcome to Imperium Gaming's WW2 Axis VS Allies RP!\n\nThis server is running a custom MRP gamemode known as 'ImperiumRP' (We are not another DarkRP re-name or a NS Clone!)\n\nThis Help Menu will guide you through the huge amount of custom servers features, gameplay, and custom content (Mostly all made by Murlock over the span of 2 years). In short, this server is run by the players, including the Frontline (current map) that can be advanced by actions (F7 menu). Need to reopen this help menu? Type /help in chat anytime!\n\nSelect a topic on the left to learn more.\n\nGetting Started:\n\nYou have spawned in as a recruit, to progress you need to get trained and  join a Division! Type '/ooc I need to get trained!' but dont worry if you dont get trained right away, you can still get a weapon by finding the Weapons Crate, click E on it, and choose your starting weapon. Have an explore, and someone should get around to training you. \n\nAnd again Welcome to the Server!\n\n-Murlock",    
    ["Unlocking Weapons"] = "You can unlock weapons at the Weapon Crate located near spawn. Your Division, including recruits, will have base weapons already unlocked for you to use.\n\nThere are Primary, Secondary, and Miscellaneous slots where you can customize your loadout. You earn QM Points by killing players, playing in events, some actions, looting bodys, and actively playing on the server. These QM Points can then be used at the Weapon Crate to unlock new weapons!\n\nIn addition to Division-provided base weapons, some weapons are unlocked through specific classes, such as the Sniper class. There are also VIP only weapons that are not overpowered and are just for fun.",
    ["Outposts"] = "Outposts are extremely important for reinforcing the frontline. Without an outpost, it will be difficult to get players to the front lines, and you may lose the objective!\n\nThere are two main types of outposts: Command Posts (created by the 2nd and 7th) and Mobile Outposts (created by the 29th and 21st).\n\nCommand Posts act like forward bases. They can only be established by a 2nd or 7th Engineer. When one is created, the engineer must stay near it while it is being established. Once established, supply needs to be brought from the Supply Depot by pressing E on it and transporting it to the Command Post (this can be done more easily with the rope tool and a vehicle!). Once established and supplied, enemies can attack the outpost by contesting and eventually destroying it. If there are more enemies than friendlies nearby, you will be unable to spawn at the Command Post!\n\nMobile Outposts are simpler. They can be spawned by 29th and 21st logistics from the Vehicle Spawner. These hold a maximum of 25 supplies.",

    ["Hand Swep"] = "The Hand Swep is a custom SWEP that allows you to move props and objects by holding left click and dragging.\n\nThis can be used to move barrles, corpses, props, and anything else that is not nailed down!\n\nIts a very fun swep and adds a lot of gmod goofines to the server... Prop Killing is allowed if you can pull it off, and can lead to some extreamly fun moments.\n\nRight Click allows you to Salute, and Left Click allows you to move objects.",
    ["Levels and XP"] = "ImperiumRP has three main stats:\n\nEndurance (Health Regen)\nAthletics (Faster Run and Higher Jump)\nBallistics (Less Recoil and Spread)\n\nAll these states give a small bonus in its respective field, making high level players more effective in combat. Saying that, a level 1 player can still kill a level 70 player, but the level 70 player will have a slight advantage. Killing a higher level player means you gain more XP!\n\nYou can level up and gain XP by playing on the server, killing players, looting bodys, and collecting Supply. You can view your level and stats by pressing F1. You start with 10 points to spend.\n\nEvery Level gets you 2 points to spend on your Character, however levels will get exponentially harder to obtain, being around level 70+ is considered a max leveled player.\n\nSome players played during WW2, and this allows them to carry over there skils they had before, as they are veterans.",
    ["VIP"] = "This server is run on donations. All of the money goes into funding custom content (like the ImperiumRP gamemode!) and paying for the Server Box, our Linux Machine in the Background that runs alot of our custom features, and our Webiste!\n\nDonate by typing /donate\n\nVIP gets you VIP only weapons, Double XP and QM points, and a role in our discord! The Donation helps us keep this server alive, and we are beyond appreciative for everyone who has helped us financially in making our dream server!\n\nIf you buy a Supply Drop package do /claim to get it in game!",
    ["Reviving and Looting"] = "In this gamemode, when you die your corpse will remain on the battlefield. This can be dragged around and the player (if they have not respawned) can see whats going on.\n\nYou can be revived by a Medic, and can see how close the nearest medic is. Medics will get a green glow around all players that can be revived, so can see your corpse through walls.\n\nTo prevent players being revived you can loot there corpses, this will take 5 seconds and you will gain supply, XP and QM points!\n\nLooting bodys is the best way to gain QM points! Bodys will despawn 10mins after the player has died.",
    ["Nazism"] = "As per the Server Operator Rules, we do not allow any form of Nazism nor the Glorification of Nazism on the server.\n\nThis includes the Display of swastikas, the nazi salute or other glorification of nazism is prohibited, even for 'roleplay' purposes.\n\nWe take this very seriously, and any form of Nazism will result in a permanent ban from the server.\n\nWe are a WW2 Axis VS Allies RP server, and we do not support nor glorify Nazism in any way. We are a military focused roleplay server, and we expect all players to act accordingly. There can be no ideological or political roleplay promoting nazism in ANY form.\n\nIf you see any form of Nazism on the server, please report it to an admin immediately.",
    ["Actions"] = "Actions are Objectives that can be completed for rewards, mainly Organisation. Organisation lowers the respawn timers on Entities and Vehicles (such as Tanks and Artillery) but can also be used to call a Major Action such as a Consolidation Action to progress the frontline.\n\nTo Call an Action you must be trusted in your division, and there must be a balance of players. Once started, both sides will be notified and you can track your progression in the bottom right of the screen and in the F7 menu.\n\nCancelling or Failing an action will result in a loss of Organisation.\n\nThe Consolidation is the way to progress the frontline, when started the defenders (the one who called the action) must defend 50% of the map for 20 mins. If they fail, then the frontline will not progress. When you start this action, your Organisation will be reduced to 0, and you need 100% to call one (as well as full control over the map). Attackers can contest the active objective and gain 5mins extra time for every point they capture.",
    ["Objectives"] = "Every map can have up to 10 Objectives. They are in a Capture Order seen on the HUD. If there is no highlighted objective, then any objective can be captured. However if Capture in Order is enabled, then only the active Objectives can be captured.\n\nFor most Actions, these serve as critical positions to complete the Objectives. To advance the Frontline all Objectives need to be captured to start Consolidation.\n\nCapture Rate depends on the number of total objectives on the map, if there are more than 5, then capture rate will increase.",
    ["Division Management"] = "In the F3 menu you can click on the Management Menu. This is where Officers of a Division can track playtime of players, but also see the current division rank and set players permissions. There are 3 levels of permissions, Members, Trusted, and Admins. When you are Trusted you can do most things, such as promote, demote, whitelist, kick, and call Actions. Admins can do the same, but have the power to remove and add trusted. Server Admins on the server have the power to add and remove Admins / Trusted.\n\nThe Rank Ceiling is the top rank anyone can have in a Division. The Top Rank (Division) can have all the ranks, but lower ranks can only go up to there Rank Ceiling.\n\nTIPS FOR OFFICERS:\n\nUse the Commendation System! Ontop of looking at Time Played on the Division for a player, get people to Commend players who have done well! This is a great way to see who needs promoting or not. F2 then click Commend, its that easy!\n\nMake NCOs trusted! If a NCO is doing well, give them trusted permissions early!",
