    ["Intro"] = "Welcome to Imperium Gamings WARHAMMER 40KRP!\n\nThis server is running a custom MRP gamemode known as 'ImperiumRP' with custom Hive Bots running LLMS!\n\nThis Help Menu will guide you through the huge amount of custom servers features, gameplay, and custom content (Mostly all made by Murlock over the span of 2 years). In short, this server is run by the players, including the fully alive City with hundreds of living bots. Need to reopen this help menu? Type /help in chat anytime!\n\nSelect a topic on the left to learn more.\n\nGetting Started:\n\nYou have spawned in as a recruit, to progress you need to get trained. Type '/ooc I need to get trained!' but dont worry if you dont get trained right away, you can still get a weapon by finding the Weapons Crate, click E on it, and choose your starting weapon. Have an explore, and someone should get around to training you. \n\nAnd again Welcome to the Server!\n\n-Murlock",
    ["Unlocking Weapons"] = "You can unlock weapons at the Weapon Crate located near spawn. Your Division, including recruits, will have base weapons already unlocked for you to use.\n\nThere are Primary, Secondary, and Miscellaneous slots where you can customize your loadout. You earn Credits a number of ways, playing in events, looting bodys, and actively playing on the server. These Credits can then be used at the Weapon Crate to unlock new weapons!\n\nIn addition to Division-provided base weapons, some weapons are unlocked through specific classes, such as the Heavy Weapons. There are also VIP only weapons that are not overpowered and are just for fun.",

    ["Hand Swep"] = "The Hand Swep is a custom SWEP that allows you to move props and objects by holding left click and dragging.\n\nThis can be used to move barrles, corpses, props, and anything else that is not nailed down!\n\nIts a very fun swep and adds a lot of gmod goofines to the server... Prop Killing is allowed if you can pull it off, and can lead to some extreamly fun moments.\n\nRight Click allows you to Salute, and Left Click allows you to move objects.",
    ["Levels and XP"] = "ImperiumRP has three main stats:\n\nEndurance (Health Regen)\nAthletics (Faster Run and Higher Jump)\nBallistics (Less Recoil and Spread)\n\nAll these states give a small bonus in its respective field, making high level players more effective in combat. Saying that, a level 1 player can still kill a level 70 player, but the level 70 player will have a slight advantage. Killing a higher level player means you gain more XP!\n\nYou can level up and gain XP by playing on the server, killing players, looting bodys, and playing in events. You can view your level and stats by pressing F1. You start with 10 points to spend.\n\nEvery Level gets you 2 points to spend on your Character, however levels will get exponentially harder to obtain, being around level 70+ is considered a max leveled player.\n\nSome players played during WW2, and this allows them to carry over there skils they had before, as they are veterans.",
    ["VIP"] = "This server is run on donations. All of the money goes into funding custom content (like the ImperiumRP gamemode!) and paying for the Server Box, our Linux Machine in the Background that runs alot of our custom features, and our Webiste!\n\nDonate by typing /donate\n\nVIP gets you VIP only weapons, Double XP and Credis points, and a role in our discord! The Donation helps us keep this server alive, and we are beyond appreciative for everyone who has helped us financially in making our dream server!\n\nIf you buy a Supply Drop package do /claim to get it in game!",

This can be dragged around and the player (if they have not respawned) can see whats going on.\n\nYou can be revived by a Medic, and can see how close the nearest medic is.

This is where Officers of a Division can track playtime of players, but also see the current division rank and set players permissions. There are 3 levels of permissions, Members, Trusted, and Admins. When you are Trusted you can do most things, such as promote, demote, whitelist, kick, and call Actions. Admins can do the same, but have the power to remove and add trusted. Server Admins on the server have the power to add and remove Admins / Trusted.\n\nThe Rank Ceiling is the top rank anyone can have in a Division. The Top Rank (Division) can have all the ranks, but lower ranks can only go up to there Rank Ceiling.\n\nTIPS FOR OFFICERS:\n\nUse the Commendation System! Ontop of looking at Time Played on the Division for a player, get people to Commend players who have done well! This is a great way to see who needs promoting or not. F2 then click Commend, its that easy!\n\nMake NCOs trusted! If a NCO is doing well, give them trusted permissions early!",
    ["The Chem Runners"] = "The Chem Runners hold control over the criminal underworld thanks to their brutal tactics and monopoly on SPOOK, the only major drug found in the Hive.\n\nIn recent decades, a bloody gang war ended with the Chem Runners securing total control over its production.\n\nToday, their influence can be felt in every corner of the Hive, with Chem Runners distributing SPOOK on every street and in every apartment. You need only look beneath the floorboards to find these heretics.\n\nThe Administratum, however, has declared zero tolerance for narcotics. Any individual found in possession of SPOOK shall be sentenced to penal conscription... or summary execution.\n\nSome heretical Guardsmen may buy SPOOK from Chem Runners and sell it to innocents for profit.\n\nType /drugs to open your drug inventory.\nLoyal Imperium servants may use /search on a player to search for hidden SPOOK.",
    ["Lore Overview"] = "Hive Imperium exists in the Scarus Sector // Segmentum Obscurus. It is an isolated hive world with little contact from the greater Imperium, causing the Emperor’s light to dim.\n\nDark shadows loom over the city, as Chaos forces instigate a blood revolution, a plague of pestilence, and a powerful drug empire. The war for control of the city is being lost.\n\nWith every passing hour, the likelihood of the planet being marked for Exterminatus increases. Only those brave enough to conscript into the Astra Militarum offer any hope of salvation.\n\nThese Guardsmen, often the few who volunteer from the local population, are tasked with keeping the Hive under control and preventing its collapse to ruinous powers.\n\nYet in times of crisis... opportunity always presents itself.",
    ["Khornate Cultists"] = "Khornate Cultists dwell in the deepest parts of the Hive. Their cults grow strong through the sacrifice of innocents to the insatiable hunger of the Blood God.\n\nSkulls, blood, flesh... it is demanded constantly. The rush of the kill, the joy of slaughter, Khorne infects the minds of ordinary mortals, convincing them to murder, to slay. Eventually, that hunger breaks free.\n\nThey kill without mercy. Crimson ribbons streak across the floor, a sacrifice to grow the power of the Blood God.\n\nThrough dark rituals, Skull Takers may rise from the civilian population, hunting for a great slaughter. If such beings appear, it is almost certain that Khornate Cultists are preparing for a blood revolution.\n\nSeek them out in the darkest corners of the Hive... before it is too late.",
    ["Nurgle Pestilence"] = "Nurgle's disease infects the hearts of the impure and unfaithful. Those who have forsaken the Emperor's protection and drift into shadow are embraced instead by pestilence.\n\nOnly those true to the Emperor, or those who take SPOOK regularly, can resist the taint of Nurgle.\n\nThose blessed by decay come to enjoy the suffering, the truth: that all things must rot, and all shall return to one in the Grand Cycle.\n\nBefore long, the infected begin to transform into unholy Poxwalkers, spreading disease and pestilence to all they touch. Only the faithful may resist its grip.\n\nSoon, entire sectors of the Hive may be consumed by corruption, requiring fire and flame to cleanse their souls.\n\nIf the infection spreads too far, it is almost certain that Nurgle has established a foothold deep in the filth of the Underhive.",
    ["Heretical Uprisings"] = "By not controlling the Hive, you are allowing the taint of Chaos and the Unclean to infest the minds of the impure, leading to full-blown heretical revolutions such as Blood Revolutions, Plague Outbreaks, or Gang Uprisings.\n\nIt is your duty as Guardsmen to fight against such uprisings. During one, you must put down the heretics and cleanse the unclean. You will face waves upon waves of heretics, and only when they have sustained enough casualties will the uprising end.\n\nThe damage dealt by heretics and the damage taken by the player is scaled based on player count.",
    ["11th Cadian Storm Guard"] = "The 11th Cadian Storm Guard are a veteran regiment originally assigned to Ocean World Spectoris, a planet with no continents, only endless ocean and one settlement clinging to a submerged mountain. Spectoris supplies the Imperium Hive with food and carole paste, but its waters teem with hostile life, and some whisper the sea itself is alive… and corrupted by Chaos.\n\nThe 11th were sent to defend this world from abyssal horrors and potential Chaos influence. Over centuries, they began recruiting from Spectoris and from Hive Imperium.\n\nWhen Cadia fell, the 11th did not break. Their duty remained clear: defend the Hive and Spectoris that feeds the city. Though still bearing the name of Cadia, the 11th are now their own breed, storm-hardened and duty bound by a legacy of honour.\n\nWith the Hive now under the threat of Chaos within, the 11th have deployed to keep there home city alive from danger."
